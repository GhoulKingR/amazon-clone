# Amazon clone

This Amazon clone was built using React for the front end, Stripe for payment processing, and Firebase for the back end. It was a very challenging build and so many things went wrong. But in the end, I've completed this project and you can view it in this link: https://clone-e0cb0.web.app.

Here's a screenshot of the application also:

> Since the payment processing is in test mode you can type 42 repeatedly all the way to the end of the field.
> For example:
> * Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
> * Month: 4
> * Year: 24
> * CVC: 242

I hope you have fun playing around with it!
